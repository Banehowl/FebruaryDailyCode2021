# Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors).
# Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do.

# squared(5) -> 25
# squared(9) -> 81
# squared(100) -> 10000

# Code to fix:
# def squaed(b):
#   return a * a

def squared(a):
    solution = a * a
    return(solution)

print squared(5)
print squared(9)
print squared(100)
